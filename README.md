# Natalie Grace Beauty — Simple Site

This folder contains your entire website. Upload **index.html** and the **images** folder to the **root** of your GitHub repository.

## Recommended repository name
Use a *user site* so it auto-publishes at your username domain:

**nataliegracebeauty.github.io**

(Replace with your exact GitHub username if different. For a user site, the repository name must be `<your-username>.github.io`.)

## Publish steps
1. Create the repo named above.
2. Upload `index.html` and the `images/` folder to the root.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**. For a user site repo, Pages is enabled automatically; if not, choose **Deploy from branch** (main / root).
4. Wait a moment; your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/`.

You can change the bio text or email by editing `index.html`.
